Basically, the topic that I have taken is Profile Page

#1
Homepage is the start page,
I have written a brief description about me

#2
app is the main,
where you can hover over the tab options
I have put all my details in a categorized manner using tab options and all

#3
on top of page, you can see a download button,
where I have generated a DDL for my CV and attached it to it

#4
I have used Javascripts here, for displaying the different contents at the same element in a dynamic way

#5
I have used JQuery to show the loading sign when some button is clicked or page being refreshed
