<!--
The below div with id hoverNav,
What it basically does is, I have made two hoverable side navigation bars,
which will redirect you to my social networks.
It will be hidden unless and until you hover the mouse on them.
They will pop-up until you release the mouse pointer on them.
Use transition property in the external CSS file for this purpose

<!-- Basically in the below div with class content,
I have written a brief desc of myself
And I used tables to have a proper space between each lines and show the content in an organised manner
The reason that I didn't prefer Ordered/Unordered list is,
I don't want to keep bullets for each line
